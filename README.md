# ArogyaChain: Health Records Management Using Blockchain

## Introduction
ArogyaChain is a blockchain-based solution aimed at revolutionizing the management of Electronic Health Records (EHR). The goal of this project is to implement secure, decentralized, and scalable storage of medical records by leveraging blockchain technology. The system ensures privacy and provides granular access controls, addressing the scalability challenges by storing records off-chain.

The key benefits of ArogyaChain include:
- **Security**: Utilizes blockchain for immutable and tamper-proof health records.
- **Scalability**: Incorporates off-chain storage for handling large medical data.
- **Access Control**: Granular permissions ensure only authorized users can access specific health records.

## Features
- **Decentralized Ledger**: All transactions (medical records) are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and integrity.
- **Off-Chain Storage**: Large health records are stored off-chain using IPFS, while hashes of the data are maintained on the blockchain for verification.
- **Access Control via Smart Contracts**: Patients, doctors, and hospitals are given specific permissions to access or update health records using smart contracts.
- **Auditability**: Provides complete logs of who accessed or modified a record, ensuring accountability.
